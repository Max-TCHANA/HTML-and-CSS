Divs are a block-level element used to group content together, not dissimilar to <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, <figure>, and <aside> 
which you've already seen in this course. There's one key difference, though.
Most of the time, when you want to group content together, you'll be able to do it using an HTML5 semantic element like header, nav, section, article, footer, figure, or aside. 
However, sometimes your content doesn't really fit any of these categories! In that case, 
you're encouraged to use divs to create block-level content groups.

Spans are similar to divs, except they are inline elements. You might use them to group words together, since words appear inline and not each on their own line.
Imagine the newspaper above always prints its name in bolded light green. 
You need to grab those two words — "Sun Journal" — to be able to apply CSS to them. Why not wrap them in a <span>?
