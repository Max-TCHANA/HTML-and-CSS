<!-- Strong text -->

<p>Sometimes, you'll want to make <strong>certain words</strong> more powerful than the rest of your text.</p>

<p><strong>The "strong" tag in HTML makes text bold by default.</strong></p>

<!-- Emphasized text -->

<p>Sometimes, you'll want to emphasize <em>certain words</em> more than the rest of your text.</p>

<p><em>The "em" (which stands for emphasis) tag in HTML makes text italicized by default.</em></p>



<!-- Notes 

This is a very good question. Remember that HTML controls content, not appearances. CSS controls appearances instead. 
By adding <strong> or <em> tags around text you want to make stronger or emphasize, you can use CSS later to change the default behavior of that text. 
For example, even though <strong> makes text bold by default, you can add custom CSS to make <strong> elements red instead of bold.
Either way, the text is stronger. 
Making it "bold" isn't what counts; it's the importance of the text that matters, and how you reflect that in the text's appearance is up to you.
