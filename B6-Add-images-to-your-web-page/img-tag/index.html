<!-- The tag for images, is <img>. Image tags can just stand by themselves: <img>. No closing tag necessary!
The contents of the src attribute indicate where the image is stored. An image can be loaded from:
A URL that's already online (like an image on another website)
A file that's loaded from elsewhere in your codebase

Once you have told the <img> tag where the image is located (via the src attribute), you must add a description of the image within another attribute: alt.
Think of "alt" like "alternative text." If someone is using a screen reader and can't see your image with their eyes, they will see the descriptive text of the image instead.
So will search engines, which is important for SEO.

The attribute title: The title of your image appears when a user hovers over the image itself, as in the Millie Hughes-Fulford image above. 
See how hovering with the cursor brings up the contents of the title attribute?
