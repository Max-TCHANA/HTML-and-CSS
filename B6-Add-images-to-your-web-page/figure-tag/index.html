<!-- 
Now that you know how to insert images plain and simple, HTML also offers a specific kind of image tag for figures. 
A figure is an image that could be moved around in your web page without dramatically altering the "flow" of the page. 
This is similar to how we think of figures in an encyclopedia, for example. 
Because they're labelled, they can be next to one paragraph or another, and it doesn't really matter.
Figures also allow for captions. Fun fun! To insert a figure, surround your <img> tag with two other tags: <figure> and <figcaption>.

<figure>
    <img src="0.jpg" alt="Portray showing Max Tchana" 
	title="Max Tchana">
    <figcaption>A picture representing Max Tchana</figcaption>
</figure>
