font-weight
Adapting the weight of your font via CSS will cause your text to appear bolder or lighter than normal.
Example:
a {
    font-weight: normal;
}

font-style
We can't talk about bold text without talking about italics! To italicize text, you'll use the font-style property. 
It can also be combined with a font-weight property if you like. The font-style property has two other possible values: 
normal and oblique. Oblique text vaguely resembles italic text but takes up more horizontal space. You'll rarely use it.
Example:
a {
    font-style: italic;
    font-weight: 200;
}

text-decoration
The <strong> HTML tag produces bold text by default, the <em> HTML tag produces italicized text by default, 
but no HTML element produces underlined text by default.
You must use CSS to accomplish this, no matter what. The text-decoration property will help you out.
It can take multiple values:
underline
none
line-through
Example:
a {
    text-decoration: underline;
}


text-transform
The text-transform property will most often take one of the following values:

capitalize
uppercase
lowercase

Example:
a {
    font-weight: 200;
    font-family: Helvetica;
    text-decoration: none;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    color: #151814;
}

Styles based on status
CSS pseudo-classes

some pseudo-classes that are commonly applied to links:

:visited
:hover
:active

You can find the full list of pseudo-classes here
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes


:visited
Web links are blue by default and purple when they've visited.
Example:
a:visited {
    color: #858C7B;
}

:hover
When a user hovers over elements like buttons or links, it can be helpful to have a visual change take place on the element. 
Use the pseudo-class "hover" to apply this change to any element!
Example:
a:hover {
    color: #151814;
    background-color: #DFFFD6;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-weight: normal;
}

:active
When an element is clicked, it's nice to show a little visual effect to increase the sensation of interactivity. 
A light visual effect can be pleasant when an element is clicked. In this case, 
the clicked element is an "active" element only while the mouse button is pressing down on it.
Example:
a:active {
    background-color: #F3FFE1;
}

CSS rule: if you're using them, you should specify pseudo-classes in a particular order. 
That order is :visited, :hover, and then :active
