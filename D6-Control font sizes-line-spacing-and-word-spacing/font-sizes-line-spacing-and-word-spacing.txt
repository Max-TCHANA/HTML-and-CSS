Font sizing
Several units of measurement are available to control font size in CSS:

pixels
em
rem
percentages

The 3 different sets of CSS below all result in the same new font sizes:

/* pixels */
h1 {
    font-size: 48px;
}

p {
    font-size: 18px;
}

/* ems */
h1 {
    font-size: 3em;
}

p {
    font-size: 1.125em;
}

/* percentages */
h1 {
    font-size: 300%;
}

p {
    font-size: 112.5%;
}

line-height
In CSS, you control the vertical space between lines of text using the line-height property. 
This can particularly help with the readability of long paragraphs.
Example:
#code-of-conduct {
    line-height: 1.4em;
}

letter-spacing
Increasing the space between letters is often useful when dealing with headings in all-caps.
You should always give this value in the em or rem unit so it is proportional to the font the user has set in their browser.
Example:
h2 {
    letter-spacing: 0.08em;
}

word-spacing
You won't often need to increase the space between words, but it can be useful for poetic or literary effect. 
You should always give this value in the em or rem unit so it is proportional to the font the user has set in their browser.
