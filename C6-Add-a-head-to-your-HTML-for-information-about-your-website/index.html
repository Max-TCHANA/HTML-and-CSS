As you start creating real pages with all of this awesome content on them, 
you'll need to give browsers information about the pages themselves.

This HTML page structure is not very "fun" to create because it has no visible content yet, but it is very necessary.

First, define the document type, which is HTML. This should become a line of code you robotically type when you're creating new HTML, 
and you don't need to think about it much beyond this.

Start your HTML content with an opening <html> tag that includes a language attribute. This could be "en" for English, "fr" for French, "hi" for Hindi, or something else. 
It helps screenreaders (a tool used people who have difficulty seeing) know which language to read out loud. 
There are more than 8000 languages to choose from, but in your career, you'll probably use a few at most.

Define and close the document's <head>.

Define the document's body and fill it with the elements you've already learned about in this course 
(sections, articles, headings, paragraphs, images, whatever's necessary for your page).

Conclude your HTML content with a closing </html> tag.

<head>
Some common information is almost always included in a HTML file's head:

page title

links to your CSS files or page icon

meta data that used for social sharing

The total sum of all these elements could resemble this html code below.

*******

Although this all looks complicated, it's just a series of three tags: <title>, <link>, and <meta>. They have different attributes each time they're listed.

<title>: define a site title using the <title> tag. Put your site's title between the opening and closing <title> tags.

<link>: tell your HTML document where your CSS lives or where your site's icon lives by specifying an href attribute (pointing to the file location), 
type (specifying the kind of document), and rel attribution (specifying its relationship to the HTML. These are standard lines of code you can almost copy and paste every time.

<meta>: specify as many types of meta data as you need. <meta charset="utf-8"> is a good line of code to set in your HTML pages 
so that your page can display any type of characters (English, Korean, etc), even if the page is mostly in one main language.
