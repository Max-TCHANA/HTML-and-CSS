<!-- 
Structural elements in HTML include:

<header>: the section at the top of a web page that often includes a logo and sometimes a nav

<nav>: a set of menu items that allow a user to navigate to different pages on a site

<section>: a general section of related content

<article>: a piece of content that can be independently shared, like a blog post or newspaper article 
(even if you don't display the full article text, like you just show a preview, you can still use an article tag to delineate this content)

<footer>: the section at the bottom of a page that often has additional links and perhaps social sharing icons

<aside>: content that is complementary but not crucial to the page's main content (this could be an informative side section on a related subject)

<figure>: a grouped image and caption that create an informative visual of some kind
