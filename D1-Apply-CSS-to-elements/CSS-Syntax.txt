CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets," 
which means that the CSS you write "cascades" throughout your style file. 

*****************************
CSS syntax is given below:

selector {
  property: value;
}
*****************************

selector: the HTML element you want to modify. It's called a "selector" because you're selecting the element. Fancy that!
property: the element's CSS property you want to modify, like its color, spacing, etc.
value: the new value of the CSS property, like "blue" for its color.

Examples: 

p {
    color: white;
    background-color: blue;
    font-family: Arial;
}

You can also select elements based on class or id. To select an element using a class from its HTML, use a period. 
The following code selects all elements with a class of "warning":

.warning {
    background-color: orange;
}

To select an element using an id from its HTML, use a pound sign. 
The following code selects the element with an id of "intro":

#intro {
    color: blue;
}

NB: If the same element is affected by multiple appearance modifications, 
the line of code farthest down the CSS page will take precedence.

Example: In the following example, the relevant paragraph would be teal -- not indigo!
p {
    color: indigo;
}

p {
    color: teal;
}
