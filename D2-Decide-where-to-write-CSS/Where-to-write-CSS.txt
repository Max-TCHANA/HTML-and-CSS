CSS can be written either:
- outside your HTML file
- inside your HTML file

********************

External CSS:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>YOUR PAGE TITLE</title>
        <link href=“css/style.css” type=“text/css” rel=“stylesheet” /> 
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>SOME HTML, WOOHOO</h1>
    </body>
</html>

The <link> element in the HTML's <head> tells the page where to find its matching CSS. 
It should have the following attributes:

href: the file path to the CSS. 
If you structure your project as shown in the image at the top of the chapter, this will be "css/style.css."

type: describes the type of link, which will always be "text/css" for your stylesheets

rel: describes the relationship between the pages, which will always be "stylesheet" for your stylesheets
There is no closing tag necessary for the <link> element!

********************

Internal CSS:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Internal CSS</title>
        <style type=“text/css”>
            h1 {
                color: green;
            } 
        </style> 
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>SOME HTML, WOOHOO</h1>
    </body>
</html>

A <style> tag within the HTML file's <head> defines the CSS for the page. 
This is fine if you only have a couple lines of CSS. However, it can quickly become unwieldy. 
It's not fun to read lines and lines of CSS in a file before the actual page content even starts!

Inline CSS:
You can even write CSS directly on elements in the HTML's body. In that case, you don't need to actually select them, 
since it's clear (based on where you place the style tag) which element you want to change the appearance of using CSS:

<h1 style="color: blue;">This will be a blue heading</h1>
