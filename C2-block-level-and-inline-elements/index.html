<!-- 

Every HTML element has a default block-level or inline behavior. Paragraphs are block-level elements, 
which means that they block off a whole line for themselves, and images are inline elements, 
which means they will automatically be placed next to one another on the same line.

Block-level elements that you've seen so far include:

- Headings

- Paragraphs (p)

- Lists and list items (ul, ol, li)

- Structuring elements (header, nav, section, article, aside, figure, footer)

Inline elements that you've seen so far include:

- Images (img)

- Emphasized text (em)

- Strong text (strong)

- Links (a)
