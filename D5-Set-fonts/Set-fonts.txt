Fonts can make your site look unique and attractive. CSS offers you several ways to set fonts; 
the way you ultimately do so will depend on your needs.

The most common general font types you see online are:

- sans-serif fonts
- serif fonts
- monospace fonts


Installing your own fonts:

Nearly an infinite number of fonts are available for download on various websites, such as:

Font Squirrel: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/

Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/

Urban Fonts: https://www.urbanfonts.com/ 

To include an installed font as part of your project, 
you need to define a font-face rule (starting with an @ sign) 
that defines the font family and the location of the downloaded font file:

@font-face {
    font-family: 'Milkshake';
    src: url('fonts/milkshake.otf');
}

h1 {
    font-family: Milkshake;
}

As you can see, our special font is called Milkshake. 
We've saved the downloaded font in a file called "fonts" and told the CSS file to go find it there.

Just make sure you're specifying multiple font families in case the user doesn't have the first font choice installed 
on their computer, i.e.,

h2 {
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
